# Touchbar

A WPF application, written in C# that mimics the macOS Volume/Brightness HUD GUI interface.
It's based on the [WPFDraggableFrame sample application](https://github.com/NOVALISTIC/WPFDraggableFrame) by [@NOVALISTIC](https://github.com/NOVALISTIC).
It's verified working on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1. It also works on both 10 and 11 albeit with graphical bugs due to Aero being removed in these versions of Windows.

Don't judge the codebase. It's quite a bit sketchy and messy, basically done as best as my 14 year old mind could do back then.
